# 2DEX

2DEX is a library that wraps around Java2D, meant to provide an
easier (and higher level) way to create games, GUIs, and other
graphical programs using Java.

This library provides the developer with abstractions for both
graphical and mouse/keyboard inputs event handling, as well as
rendering and tick handlers. The rest is up to the developer
(including, at the moment, audio).
